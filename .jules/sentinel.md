## 📝 Vulnerability Log

### Incomplete HTML Escaping in JS
- **Date Fixed**: 2024-XX-XX
- **Location**: `js/improve-all.js`
- **Vulnerability**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Description**: The `esc` function used to sanitize strings before inserting them into `innerHTML` failed to escape single quotes (`'`).
- **Risk**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts by crafting inputs that break out of HTML attributes using single quotes.
- **Fix**: Updated the regular expression to include the single quote (`/[&<>"'/]/g`) and added a mapping for the single quote to its HTML entity `&#39;` in the replacement object.
- **Lesson Learned**: Always use comprehensive escaping functions that cover all critical characters (`&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `/`) when dynamically generating HTML strings to prevent XSS.
